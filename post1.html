	  	When I first started using Git, I used Git's Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the mac. It does a decent job satisfying your basic needs, but it's very limited. It also hides the real inner workings of Git that you should really be exposed to. Additionally, there are many helpful advanced techniques you can do using the command line.
