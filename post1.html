	  	Git GUI Clients are great. There are tons of them out there.

	  	When I first started using Git, I used GitHub's GUI. A GUI is software that someone has engineered in order to provide a user with a familiar user interface full of graphical icons and visual indicators as opposed to a text-based command line interface (CLI). Windows is a GUI on top of the MS-DOS command line. In order to spare users from a steep learning curve full of memorizing commands and hard to debug errors, GUIs were developed.

	  	The GitHub GUI in particular worked for me as a beginner. It did a decent job satisfying my basic needs, but it's very limited, especially in a team-based setting. It also hides the real inner workings of Git that you need to be exposed to if you're going to develop software professionally. There are many advanced Git techniques capable via the command line, but this blog will just go over the basics to get you started. Let the training begin Luke.

	  	In order to begin, you need to install git to your command line. On Mac this can either be done by simply downloading Xcode or by going <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git" target="_blank">here</a>. You'll know you're ready to rock and roll when you type in "git --version" in terminal and terminal responds with your version of git you have installed.
